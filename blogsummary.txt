 In his previous letter, Learn Anything Fast, I shared insights on how to quickly acquire new skills and knowledge . Today, I want to take that a step further by introducing the concept of the "New School" and providing a practical framework .  Traditional education dumps a lot of theory on us with little practical use . It’s one-size-fits-all and doesn’t adapt to individual needs or changing industries . Many people leave school feeling unprepared for the real world, armed with outdated knowledge and skills .  Here’s a step-by-step guide, going beyond the basics to give you a comprehensive framework . I’ll walk you through each step, and a timeline to keep it all under (an average of*) 20 hours—not including the mandatory 24 hour break . I might have to revisit this list shortly because ChatGPT is releasing SearchGPT, which might reorder this considerably .  YouTube is a great resource for visual and auditory learning . Allocate about 30 minutes per video, including time to download transcripts and take notes . Step away from material for a day to let the information marinate . Use ChatGPT to combine all the information, categorize similarities and synthesize key points .  ChatGPT and Perplexity. AI are incredible tools for enhancing your learning process . Keep a journal, and even better, share it with friends, family, or start a newsletter . A newsletter is an excellent way to retain knowledge and create a personal library . Tailor your learning to fit your needs and pace . Customize your learning journey and leverage endless online resources to stay flexible and continually grow .  The future belongs to those who are adaptable and proactive in their learning journey . Effective Learning Techniques: Break down skills, eliminate distractions, and commit to focused practice . Practical Application: Apply what you learn through real-life projects and share your knowledge .
